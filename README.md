SOAP-Based 3D Molecular Representation Module for SRR-DDI
Author: Mir Mansoor Ahmad
This repository contains the SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions)–based modules developed to extend the SRR-DDI framework with three-dimensional (3D) atomic environment features. Only the original SOAP-related components are included here — the rest of the SRR-DDI source code is not redistributed.
Purpose
While SRR-DDI encodes molecules using 2D graph neural networks (GNNs), this module adds a 3D structural representation by computing SOAP descriptors that describe each atom’s local spatial environment. These SOAP embeddings are later combined (concatenated) with SRR-DDI’s graph-based features to create a unified molecular representation for drug–drug interaction (DDI) prediction.
Files Included
File	Description
non_PCA.py	Generates per-molecule SOAP descriptors from SMILES using RDKit and DScribe. Outputs soap_tokens.pkl containing padded (T_max × D_soap) matrices.
soap_io.py	Handles loading of SOAP tokens and generation of boolean masks for padded entries. Used during dataset preprocessing.
soap_encoder.py	Defines the SoapEncoder class — a neural network that converts the SOAP token matrix into a fixed 256-dimensional molecular embedding.
Integration Guide
Step 1 – Place the files
Copy the following three files into your SRR-DDI project directory (e.g., SRR-DDI/src/):
non_PCA.py
soap_io.py
soap_encoder.py
Step 2 – Generate SOAP descriptors
Before training SRR-DDI, create the SOAP token file:
python non_PCA.py --input-csv data/smiles.csv --out-pkl data/soap_tokens.pkl --r-cut 8.0 --n-max 8 --l-max 8 --sigma 0.4
This produces data/soap_tokens.pkl, where each entry corresponds to a molecule’s SOAP matrix.
Step 3 – Attach SOAP features to each drug
In SRR-DDI’s data preprocessing component (data_pre.py or dataset.py), load and attach SOAP tensors to each molecular graph:

from soap_io import load_soap_tokens, tokens_to_tensor, make_mask

soap_dict, T_max, D_soap = load_soap_tokens('data/soap_tokens.pkl')
graph.soap_tokens = tokens_to_tensor(soap_dict[drug_id]).unsqueeze(0)
graph.soap_mask = make_mask(graph.soap_tokens[0]).unsqueeze(0)
Step 4 – Combine SOAP with graph features
In SRR-DDI’s model file (e.g., model.py), import and instantiate the encoder:

from soap_encoder import SoapEncoder
self.soap_encoder = SoapEncoder(token_in_dim=soap_in_dim)

Then, in the fusion section of the model (where GNN embeddings are pooled), concatenate the SOAP embedding s with the graph embedding d_g:

s = self.soap_encoder(soap_tokens, soap_mask)
d_g = torch.cat([global_max_pool(sub, batch), global_mean_pool(sub, batch)], dim=-1)
fused = torch.cat([d_g, s], dim=-1)

This fused vector represents both 2D topological and 3D geometric molecular features.
Workflow Summary
SMILES → 3D geometry (RDKit/ASE)
      → SOAP descriptors (non_PCA.py)
      → SOAP tokens + mask (soap_io.py)
      → Encoded 3D embedding (soap_encoder.py)
      → Concatenation with SRR-DDI GNN features
      → DDI prediction
Notes
• Best-performing SOAP configuration: l_max = 8, n_max = 8, r_cut = 8, σ = 0.4
• The SOAP branch outputs a 256-dimensional embedding that complements SRR-DDI’s GNN representation.
• You can disable or ablate this branch in SRR-DDI via model options (if supported).
